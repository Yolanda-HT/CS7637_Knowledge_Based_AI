# 02 - Introduction to CS7637

## Class Goals
- Core methods of knowledge-based AI
- Tasks addressed by knowledge-based AI
- How knowledge-based AI agents use these methods to address there tasks
- The relationship between AI and human cogniion

## Class Outcomes
- Design and implement a knowlege-based AI agent
- Use these strategies and agents to address complex, practical problems
- Use the design and results of these agents to reflect on human cognition

## Principles of CS7637
1. KBAI agents represent and organize knowledge into knowledge structures to guide and support reasoning.
2. Learning in KBAI agents is often incremental.
3. Reasoning in KBAI agents is top-down as well as bottom-up.
4. KBAI agents match methods to tasks.
5. KBAI agents use heuristics to find solutions that are good enough, though not necessarily optimal.
6. KBAI agents make use of recurring patterns in the problems they solve.
7. The architecture of KBAI agents enables reasoning, learning, and memory to support and constrain each other.
