## Means-Ends Analysis
- For each operator that can be applied:
	- Apply the operator to the current state
	- Calculate difference between new state and goal state
- Prefer state that minimizes distance between new state and goal state

## Problem Reduction
In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a reduction is an algorithm for transforming one problem into another problem. A sufficiently efficient reduction from one problem to another may be used to show that the second problem is at least as difficult as the first.


*Means-Ends analysis is weak method (does not acquired a lot of knowledge or not knowledge intensive)*
