	- Set B, Basic Problems only. 
	- The goal of this milestone is simply to ensure you’ve set up your local project infrastructure and familiarized yourself with Gradescope. 
	- You will receive 100% of your performance credit as long as your agent answers any problem correctly. Your report will focus on early ideas you have for approaching the project.
- [Milestone 2](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-2/)
	- Set B, all problems. 
	- The goal of this milestone is to ensure you have started on the early, easier problems early in the semester. 
	- As long as your agent can answer 5 (out of 12) Basic B and 5 (out of 12) Test B problems correctly, you will receive full performance credit.
- [Milestone 3](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-3/)
	- Set C. 
	- The goal of this milestone is to ensure you have generalized your approach out to the more difficult 3x3 problems by an appropriate time of the semester. 
	- As long as your agent can answer 5 (out of 12) Basic C and 5 (out of 12) Test C problems correctly, you will receive full performance credit.
- [Milestone 4](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-4/)
