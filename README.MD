# RPM Project (Raven’s Progressive Matrices)
[Project overview](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-1/)
- [Milestone 1](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-1/)
	- Set B, Basic Problems only. 
	- The goal of this milestone is simply to ensure you’ve set up your local project infrastructure and familiarized yourself with Gradescope. 
	- You will receive 100% of your performance credit as long as your agent answers any problem correctly. Your report will focus on early ideas you have for approaching the project.
- [Milestone 2](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-2/)
	- Set B, all problems. 
	- The goal of this milestone is to ensure you have started on the early, easier problems early in the semester. 
	- As long as your agent can answer 5 (out of 12) Basic B and 5 (out of 12) Test B problems correctly, you will receive full performance credit.
- [Milestone 3](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-3/)
	- Set C. 
	- The goal of this milestone is to ensure you have generalized your approach out to the more difficult 3x3 problems by an appropriate time of the semester. 
	- As long as your agent can answer 5 (out of 12) Basic C and 5 (out of 12) Test C problems correctly, you will receive full performance credit.
- [Milestone 4](https://lucylabs.gatech.edu/kbai/spring-2022/milestone-4/)
	- Sets D and E. The goal of this milestone is to ensure you have looked at all four sets before the final project deadline, so that you may spend the last portion of the semester refining, improving, and writing your final report. 
	- As long as your agent can answer 10 (out of 24) Basic D & E and 10 (out of 24) Test D & E problems, you will receive full performance credit.
