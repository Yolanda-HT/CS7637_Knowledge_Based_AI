# 01 - Intro to Knowledge Based AI

## Conundrums in AI
- Intelligent agents have limited resources.
- Computation is local, but problems have global constraints.
- Logic is deducitve, but many problems are not.
- The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited.
- Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex, but explanation and justification are even more complex.

## Characteristics of AI Problems
- Knowledge often arrives incrementally.
- Problems exhibit recurring patterns.
- Problems have multiple levels of granularity.
- Many problems are computationally intractable.
- The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static.
- The world is open-ended, but knowledge is limited.

## Characteristics of AI Agents
- Agents have limited computing power.
- Agents have limited sensors.
- Agents have limited attention.
- Computational logic is fundamentally deductive.
- AI agents' knowledge is incomplete relative to the world.
