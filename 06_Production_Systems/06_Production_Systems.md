## Cognitive Architecture
- What is a cognitive
    - Function that maps percepts to action
    - f: P* -> A
- Levels of cognitive architectures
    - Low level:
        - Hardware / Implementation
        - E.g. a brain, a transistor
    - Mid level:
        - Algorithm / Symbol level
        - E.g. means-ends analysis, semantic networks
    - High level:
        - Task / Knowledge level
        - E.g. selecting a pitch, playing baseball

## SOAR (A specific architecture of deliberation)
- Long term memory
    - Procedural (How to do some things)
    - Semantic (Generalizations in the form of concepts and models of the world)
    - Episodic (Events, specific incidencts)
- Working memory

## Assumptions of a Cognitive Architecture
- Goal-oriented
- Rich, complex environment
- Significant knowledge
- Symbols and abstractions
- Flexible and function of the environment
- Learning
